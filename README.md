 Vigenere Cipher Decryption and Text Processing

This Python project focuses on breaking the Vigenere Cipher, which involves exploring various Python string functions, file handling techniques, and leveraging dictionaries for efficient data management. The project consists of several key tasks designed to deepen your understanding of Python's capabilities while working with text data.

Key tasks include:

String Manipulation: Explore built-in Python string functions, such as find() and replace(), to efficiently search and modify strings. Understanding these functions is crucial for handling and processing textual data.
File Handling: Learn how to read and process files from your local system. By reading files like sherlock.txt, you'll practice converting the contents into strings for further manipulation and analysis.
Text Cleaning Function: Develop a Python function that processes a text file and removes all non-letter characters, leaving only the letters. This task strengthens your ability to work with loops, conditionals, and string manipulation techniques.
Dictionaries: Dive into Python dictionaries to handle complex data structures and enhance your understanding of their power compared to lists. Use dictionaries in practical scenarios such as frequency analysis or mapping cipher keys.
This project serves as an introduction to text processing, cryptography, and efficient data management techniques, making it an excellent foundation for further exploration of Python programming.
